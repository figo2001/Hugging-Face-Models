# Introduction to Hugging Face Models

This repository provides an introduction to using Hugging Face models for various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It is designed to be beginner-friendly and includes a comprehensive notebook that walks through each of the following tasks:

- **Text Summarization**: Learn how to generate concise summaries from longer pieces of text using pre-trained models.
- **Tokenization**: Understand the process of breaking down text into smaller units (tokens) that models can process effectively.
- **Question-Answering**: Explore how to use models to find answers to questions from a given context or passage.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze and categorize the sentiment of text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Fine-Tuning Models**: Discover how to fine-tune pre-trained models on custom datasets for specific tasks.

## Features
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Step-by-step explanations and code examples suitable for those new to NLP and Hugging Face.
- **Comprehensive Notebook**: All tasks are demonstrated in a single Jupyter Notebook, making it easy to follow along and experiment.
